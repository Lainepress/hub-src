This package provides a utility for multiplexing multiple
GHC and Haskell Platform installations, the installation
being selected by environment variable or a hidden configuraton
file or in the current working directory or one of its parents.

Thye utility also allows users to build sandboxes (called hubs)
which may link to one of the the GHC installtions installed on
the local system, and extend them with packages private to the hub.

Utilities are also provided for erasing packages from an hub and
annotating, duplicating, renaming, locking, archiving and recovering
hubs.
