NAME
----
hub - syntax of XML files used to configure Haskell hubs


SYNOPSIS
--------

A Hub configuration file is an XML file that always contains a
`<hub>` node, which will contain a '<comnt>', `<hcbin>`, '<tlbin>' and
`<glbdb>` sub-nodes.

If (and only if) the file is configuring a user hub, it will also have a
`<usrgh>` and `<usrdb>` sub-nodes and possibly a `<lockd>` sub-node.


DESCRIPTION
-----------

`<comnt>`::

    Brief single-line of text describing the hub.

`<hcbin>`::

    The path of the `bin` directory containing the `ghc` tools
    to be used with the hub.
    
`<tlbin>`::
    
    The path of directory containing the generic tools (especially `cabal`)
    to be used with the hub.

`<civrn>`::
    
    The version of 'Cabal-install' to use with this hub. The presence of this
    node is optional. When present it will force the use of
    '<tlbin>/cabal-<civrn>' for the cabal executable.

`<glbdb>`::

    The path of the global package database to be used with the
    hub.

`<usrgh>`::
    
    The name of the global hub associated with this user hub (present for
    user hubs only).

`<usrdb>`::

    The path of the user package database to be used with the
    hub (present for user hubs only).

`<lockd>`::

    The presence of this node signifies that the hub is locked. If it is
    present it should contain the string "rmie".  (Only user hubs may
    be locked.)


EXAMPLE 1
---------

Hub configuration file for global hub `2011.2.0.1`:

----
    <hub>
      <comnt>Haskell Platform 2011.2.0.1</comnt>
      <hcbin>/usr/hs/ghc/7.0.3/bin</hcbin>
      <glbdb>/usr/hs/db/2011.2.0.1.d</glbdb>
    </hub>
----


EXAMPLE 2
---------

Hub configuration file for hub `home`, a user hub based
on the global hub `7.4.1`:

----
    <hub>
      <comnt>Hub for building the hub tool</comnt>
      <hcbin>/usr/hs/ghc/7.4.1/bin</hcbin>
      <tlbin>/usr/hs/tools</tlbin>
      <civrn>0.14.0</civrn>
      <usrgh>7.4.1</usrgh>
      <glbdb>/usr/hs/db/7.4.1.d</glbdb>
      <usrdb>/home/chris/.hubrc/lib/hub-src/package.config</usrdb>
    </hub>
